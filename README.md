# CNT4007_Project_Fall_2023

This is "our" final submission for the CNT4007 Peer Process Project.

The only working files are all lumped together inside the "testing" folder and most if not all of the working code is inside peerProcess.java. The Message files were written by Yudi Zhang, but most went unused besides the Handshake class, which was later moved into peerProcess due to compilation complications. Everything else was done by me, Mario Ponte-Garofalo, namely reading the config files, creating and printing log messages, managing new directories and files, managing TCP client and server connections between hosts, and implementing the handshake messages upon connection.

Due to the very limited time I was able to put into this project with little to no help with the actual implementation of it, I was unable to get everything fully up and running, but given enough time (and with the effort of other team members) I am confident the project could have been fully finished. 

The project is able to correctly read and store information from the Common.cfg and PeerInfo.cfg. Each peer is able to make connections to previous peers and exchange handshake messages with them. However, thats as far as I got. I was only make it about 40% of the way to a final product due to the limited manpower and responses from team members, on top of already being overloaded with projects, homework assignments, and exams from this class and others including OS, leaving me with very limited time to put into this project. Doing all the research and programming by myself while trying to figure out most of the Java functions and helper classes was very time consuming, leaving even less time to actually implement a working solution. 

I did what I could up to this point, but I believe the hard part is mostly over, besides managing bitfields, since all that is really left to do is managing the choking, sending messages to communicate between peers, and downloading the file. Sadly, despite much research on Threads, Runnables, and TimerTasks, I was not able to implement everything else in time. I may come back to this project and finish it when I have some time, and I really hate to leave it unfinished after pouring so much time and effort into research, testing, debugging, and writing code to get this far. Unfortunately, with the current circumstances, and without any substancial support from two thirds of the group, this was all I was able to accomplish in the given. All I can do is ask you to please be understanding and as lenient as possible with the grading.
